please Use command "make run";(automatically calls gtkwave)

Random test, the value of rs_1 and rs_2 are randomly generated;
Tested all ALU and BRANCH and PC-related instruction;



core_alu.v has a lot of unsed wires named instr_is_xxxx, 
this may not look nicely, but will be trimmed during synthesis and implementation,
I still keep them in the module only for debug purpose, since you can use GTK wave to see all the which instruction is being excuted.

In the core I try to use as few "comparator" as possible , I only use one comparetor for both signed and unsigned compare,
the only difference between signed and unsigned compare is to consider the MSB.



You can modifify the parameter in the core_alu_tb.cpp

#define NUM_CYCLE ((vluint64_t)2048)

#define HALF_PER_PS ((vluint64_t)5000)

#define NUM_RESET_CYCLE ((vluint64_t)10)
